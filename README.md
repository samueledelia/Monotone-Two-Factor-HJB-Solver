# Monotone-Two-Factor-HJB-Solver
The project aims to develop a fully implicit, unconditionally monotone numerical scheme for solving the two-factor uncertain volatility model, ensuring stability and convergence to the viscosity solution. It focuses on pricing financial derivatives under worst-case volatility scenarios using a hybrid discretization method.
